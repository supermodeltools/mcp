# Test Your MCP Server Configuration
#
# Use this configuration to quickly test your own MCP server with mcpbr.
# This runs a single task to validate your server configuration before
# running larger evaluations.
#
# Steps:
# 1. Update the mcp_server section below with your server details
# 2. Set any required environment variables
# 3. Run: mcpbr run -c examples/quick-start/test-your-mcp-server.yaml -vv
# 4. Review the detailed output to see your server's tools in action
#
# Expected runtime: 3-10 minutes per task
# Expected cost: $0.30-1.00
