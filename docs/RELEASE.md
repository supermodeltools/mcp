## Automated Release (Recommended)

### Using GitHub Actions UI

1. **Navigate to Actions**
   - Go to the [Actions tab](../../actions) in GitHub
   - Select "Create Release" workflow from the left sidebar

2. **Trigger the workflow**
   - Click "Run workflow" button
   - Select the version bump type:
     - `patch` - Bug fixes (0.3.24 → 0.3.25)
     - `minor` - New features (0.3.24 → 0.4.0)
     - `major` - Breaking changes (0.3.24 → 1.0.0)
   - Optionally add additional release notes
   - Click "Run workflow"

3. **Wait for completion**
   - The workflow will:
     - Calculate the new version
     - Update `pyproject.toml`
     - Sync version to all package files
     - Commit and push the changes
     - Create a git tag
     - Create a GitHub release
     - Trigger PyPI and npm publication

### Using GitHub CLI

```bash
# Patch release (bug fixes)
gh workflow run release.yml -f version_bump=patch

# Minor release (new features)
gh workflow run release.yml -f version_bump=minor

# Major release (breaking changes)
gh workflow run release.yml -f version_bump=major

# With additional notes
gh workflow run release.yml \
  -f version_bump=patch \
  -f release_notes="Special thanks to all contributors!"
```

## Manual Release

If you need to create a release manually:

### 1. Update the version

Edit `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
version = "0.3.25"  # Update this line
```

### 2. Sync versions across all files

```bash
python3 scripts/sync_version.py
```

This will update:
- `package.json`
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.claude-plugin/package.json`
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`

### 3. Commit and tag

```bash
# Commit the version bump
git add pyproject.toml package.json .claude-plugin/
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 0.3.25"
git push origin main

# Create and push tag
git tag -a v0.3.25 -m "Release v0.3.25"
git push origin v0.3.25
```

### 4. Create GitHub release

```bash
# Using gh CLI
gh release create v0.3.25 \
  --title "v0.3.25" \
  --notes "Release notes here" \
  --latest

# Or use the GitHub UI at:
# https://github.com/greynewell/mcpbr/releases/new
```

## For AI Agents

**AI agents should use the automated workflow whenever possible.** Here's the recommended workflow:

### Quick Release Workflow

```bash
# 1. Trigger the release workflow (choose patch/minor/major)
gh workflow run release.yml -f version_bump=patch

# 2. Wait for the workflow to complete (~2 minutes)
sleep 120

# 3. Verify the release was created
gh release view --json tagName,publishedAt,assets

# 4. Confirm publication to PyPI and npm
# PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/mcpbr/
# npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@greynewell/mcpbr
```

### Determining Version Bump Type

Choose the bump type based on the changes:

- **patch**: Bug fixes, documentation updates, dependency updates
  - Example: Fix Docker TypeError (#290)
  - Example: Update README with new examples

- **minor**: New features, enhancements (backward compatible)
  - Example: Add new benchmark support
  - Example: Add CSV export functionality

- **major**: Breaking changes, API changes
  - Example: Redesign CLI interface
  - Example: Remove deprecated features

### Checking Current Version

```bash
# From pyproject.toml
grep '^version' pyproject.toml

# From git tags
git describe --tags --abbrev=0

# From latest release
gh release view --json tagName -q '.tagName'
```

## Version Management

### Version Sync Script

The `scripts/sync_version.py` script ensures all package files have the same version:

- **Source of truth**: `pyproject.toml`
- **Synced files**:
  - `package.json` (npm CLI package)
  - `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
  - `.claude-plugin/package.json` (Claude plugin)
  - `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`

### Pre-commit Hook

The version sync runs automatically on commit via `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
- id: sync-version
  name: Sync version across project files
  entry: python3 scripts/sync_version.py
  language: system
  pass_filenames: false
  files: pyproject.toml
  stages: [pre-commit]
```

## What Happens on Release

When a release is published (tag pushed or GitHub release created):

### 1. PyPI Publication (`publish.yml`)
- Builds Python package
- Publishes to https://pypi.org/project/mcpbr/

### 2. npm Publication (`publish-npm.yml`)
Publishes **4 packages**:
- `@greynewell/mcpbr` - Scoped CLI package
- `mcpbr-cli` - Unscoped CLI package
- `@greynewell/mcpbr-claude-plugin` - Scoped Claude plugin
- `mcpbr-claude-plugin` - Unscoped Claude plugin

### 3. Release Drafter
- Automatically generates release notes based on merged PRs
- Groups changes by type (features, fixes, docs, etc.)
- Credits contributors

## GitHub Actions Limitation

**Important**: When the release workflow creates a release using `GITHUB_TOKEN`, it doesn't automatically trigger the PyPI and npm publish workflows. This is a GitHub Actions security feature to prevent recursive workflow triggers.

**Workaround**: After running the release workflow, manually trigger the publish workflows:

```bash
# After release workflow completes
gh workflow run publish.yml -f tag=v0.3.25
gh workflow run publish-npm.yml -f tag=v0.3.25
```

**Alternative**: Use a Personal Access Token (PAT) in the release workflow instead of `GITHUB_TOKEN` (not implemented yet, but possible future enhancement).

## Troubleshooting

### Version Mismatch Error

If you see "version does not match release tag" during npm publish:

```bash
# Sync versions
python3 scripts/sync_version.py

# Verify all versions match
grep '"version"' package.json .claude-plugin/package.json
grep '^version' pyproject.toml
```

### Failed PyPI Upload

If PyPI upload fails:
1. Check if the version already exists on PyPI
2. Bump to the next version
3. Delete the failed release and tag
4. Retry with new version

```bash
# Delete failed release
gh release delete v0.3.25 --yes

# Delete tag locally and remotely
git tag -d v0.3.25
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.3.25

# Bump version and retry
```

### Failed npm Upload

If npm upload fails:
1. Check npm token is valid
2. Verify package names are available
3. Check package.json structure

```bash
# Test npm package locally
cd /tmp
npm pack /path/to/mcpbr
tar -tzf greynewell-mcpbr-*.tgz
```

### Release Draft Not Found

The automated workflow looks for a draft release created by Release Drafter. If none exists:
- The workflow will create a release with basic notes
- You can add custom notes via the `release_notes` input

### Git Push Permission Denied

If the workflow fails to push:
- Ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` has `contents: write` permission
- Check branch protection rules allow the bot to push

## Best Practices

1. **Always use semantic versioning**: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
2. **Use automated workflow** to avoid manual errors
3. **Test releases** on TestPyPI/npm dry-run first (if critical)
4. **Update CHANGELOG.md** if maintained separately
5. **Verify publications** after release completes
6. **Never delete published releases** unless absolutely necessary

## Examples

### Example 1: Bug Fix Release

```bash
# PR #290 fixed a Docker TypeError - this is a patch
gh workflow run release.yml -f version_bump=patch
# Result: 0.3.24 → 0.3.25
```

### Example 2: New Feature Release

```bash
# Added SWE-Bench Lite support - this is a minor feature
gh workflow run release.yml -f version_bump=minor
# Result: 0.3.24 → 0.4.0
```

### Example 3: Breaking Change Release

```bash
# Redesigned CLI interface - breaking change
gh workflow run release.yml \
  -f version_bump=major \
  -f release_notes="⚠️ Breaking: CLI commands have been reorganized. See migration guide."
# Result: 0.3.24 → 1.0.0
```
